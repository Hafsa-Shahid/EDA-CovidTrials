# EDA-CovidTrials
With the data on clinincal trials of Covid-19 pandemic, I was given a task of finding insights from the data. This file contails some delebrately left incomplete codes, and the complete file can be provided upon request with the data. This was no cleaning performed on the data, just some basic EDA commands were implemented, and the questions from the data were self generated.
